# Heyo, surya-palaniswamy here. Wuss poppin?

I am currently working on projects to busy myself while my admission to masters program is finalised

I am deeply interested in
   - Computer Vision (know the basics enough to google my way through projects for now ðŸ¥²)
   - Artificial intelligence (I know it's broad but rn I have not trained myself to focus on one. Eventually hopefully!)

My current work (with no defined order or importance) are:
   - Currently figuring out a new hobby project to work on
   - Learning DSA through C++/Java
